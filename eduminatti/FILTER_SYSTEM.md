# Filter System Documentation

## Overview

The school finder application now has a fully functional filter system that allows users to search and filter schools based on multiple criteria. The system is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and efficient.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Filter Features**

### **1. Text Search**
- **Functionality**: Search schools by name or location
- **Implementation**: Real-time filtering as you type
- **Example**: Type "Doon" to find "The Doon School"

### **2. Location Filter**
- **Functionality**: Filter schools by specific cities
- **Options**: Dehradun, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, or All Locations
- **Implementation**: Dropdown selector in hero section

### **3. Advanced Filters (Sidebar)**
- **Fee Range**: 
  - Under â‚¹3,00,000 (low)
  - â‚¹3,00,000 - â‚¹5,00,000 (medium)
  - Above â‚¹5,00,000 (high)
- **School Type**: Boarding, Day Boarding, Day School
- **Gender**: Co-ed, Boys Only, Girls Only
- **Curriculum**: CBSE, IB, Cambridge
- **Minimum Rating**: 2+, 3+, 4+ Stars

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Filter Logic (`src/utils/filterUtils.js`)**

```javascript
export const filterSchools = (schools, searchQuery, selectedLocation, filters) => {
  return schools.filter(school => {
    // Search query filter
    const matchesSearch = searchQuery === '' || 
                        school.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
                        school.location.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());
    
    // Location filter
    const matchesLocation = selectedLocation === '' || school.location === selectedLocation;
    
    // Fee range filter (with actual calculation)
    const matchesFeeRange = filters.feeRange === '' || checkFeeRange(school.feeRange, filters.feeRange);
    
    // Other filters...
    return matchesSearch && matchesLocation && matchesFeeRange && matchesType && 
           matchesGender && matchesCurriculum && matchesRating;
  });
};
```

### **Fee Range Calculation**

The system intelligently calculates fee ranges by:
1. Extracting numeric values from fee strings (e.g., "â‚¹6,50,000 - â‚¹7,00,000")
2. Calculating the average fee
3. Categorizing into low, medium, or high ranges

```javascript
const checkFeeRange = (schoolFeeRange, filterFeeRange) => {
  const feeMatch = schoolFeeRange.match(/â‚¹([\d,]+)/g);
  const minFee = parseInt(feeMatch[0].replace(/[â‚¹,]/g, ''));
  const maxFee = parseInt(feeMatch[1].replace(/[â‚¹,]/g, ''));
  const avgFee = (minFee + maxFee) / 2;
  
  switch (filterFeeRange) {
    case 'low': return avgFee < 300000;
    case 'medium': return avgFee >= 300000 && avgFee <= 500000;
    case 'high': return avgFee > 500000;
    default: return true;
  }
};
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **User Interface Features**

### **1. Active Filter Display**
- Shows currently active filters in the sidebar
- Displays filter values in a readable format
- "Clear All" button to reset all filters

### **2. Search Enhancement**
- Clear button (X) in search input
- Search tips showing current search criteria
- Form submission handling

### **3. Sorting Options**
- Sort by: Rating, Name, Reviews, Established, Fee Range
- Toggle between ascending/descending order
- Visual indicators for sort direction

### **4. Results Feedback**
- Real-time result count updates
- "No results found" message with helpful tips
- Sort status indication

## ðŸ“Š **Data Structure**

### **School Object Example**
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  name: "The Doon School",
  location: "Dehradun",
  rating: 4.5,
  reviews: 245,
  feeRange: "â‚¹6,50,000 - â‚¹7,00,000",
  type: "Boarding",
  gender: "Boys",
  curriculum: "CBSE",
  established: 1935,
  amenities: ["Wifi", "Transport", "Cafeteria", "Library", "Sports", "Medical"]
}
```

## ðŸš€ **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Find Boarding Schools in Dehradun**
1. Select "Dehradun" in location dropdown
2. Set "School Type" filter to "Boarding"
3. Results: The Doon School, Welham Boys School, Welham Girls School, Woodstock School

### **Example 2: Find Affordable Co-ed Schools**
1. Set "Fee Range" to "Under â‚¹3,00,000"
2. Set "Gender" to "Co-ed"
3. Results: Ellenge School

### **Example 3: Find High-Rated IB Schools**
1. Set "Minimum Rating" to "4+ Stars"
2. Set "Curriculum" to "IB"
3. Results: Woodstock School, Cathedral and John Connon School

## ðŸ”„ **State Management**

### **Filter State Structure**
```javascript
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  feeRange: '',
  schoolType: '',
  gender: '',
  curriculum: '',
  rating: ''
});
```

### **State Updates**
- Filters update in real-time as users make selections
- All filters work together (AND logic)
- State is properly memoized for performance

## ðŸŽ¯ **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Memoized Filtering**: Uses `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary recalculations
2. **Efficient Algorithms**: Optimized filter functions
3. **Lazy Loading Ready**: Component structure supports lazy loading
4. **Minimal Re-renders**: Proper React patterns for state updates

## ðŸ”§ **Testing the Filter System**

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Empty Search**: Should show all schools
2. **Text Search**: Should filter by name/location
3. **Location Filter**: Should show only schools in selected city
4. **Combined Filters**: Should apply all filters together
5. **Clear Filters**: Should reset to show all schools
6. **Sorting**: Should sort results by selected criteria

### **Expected Behaviors**
- âœ… Real-time filtering as you type
- âœ… Multiple filters work together
- âœ… Clear all filters functionality
- âœ… Sort by different criteria
- âœ… No results message when appropriate
- âœ… Active filter display
