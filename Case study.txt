Why is it the load time to long ? 
Possible reasons : 
1. Heavy Images or Assets : If some times we use direct heavy hd images for all the content the website takes time to load
2. Too Much JavaScript : If the Script is not efficient and using many function that may not be required or can be optimized
3. Showing all the content as once : As in the website all 68 schools are loading at the same time and getting displayed
4. *Sometimes Server or hosting is slow or overloaded : Maybe the platform used for hosting is not optimal or overly crowded
5. Various component divided not optimaly : As for main content the websit includes Hero section , Chatbot , and All the content of the schools,along with filters to make searching much better 

Current Problem :
1. Long load time of content (Mentioned in the assignment)
2. Hero Section also taking long to load : Can be because of the hero section having Serching system along with designs to show school scenario (different element used to make the hero section)
3. Virtual Assistant Pop up oppening multiple times 

Solution : 
1. Compress images using formats like WebP
2. Use of lazy loading for images : i.e showing the necessary content only when required 
3. Upgrading Hosting/server
